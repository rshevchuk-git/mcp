# AWS MCP Workflow System Specification

## Executive Summary

The AWS MCP Workflow System is a compiled, secure, and community-driven workflow execution platform that extends the aws-api-mcp-server. It enables teams to contribute reusable AWS operation workflows without building full MCP servers, while maintaining enterprise-grade security and preventing prompt injection attacks.

## Core Architecture

### Compiled Workflow Model

The system treats workflows as compiled programs rather than interpreted scripts, providing immutability and security guarantees:

```
YAML Workflow → Parser → Security Validator → Dependency Resolver → Compiled Bytecode → Embeddings Index
```

**Key Innovation**: Workflows are compiled at build-time into immutable execution plans, preventing runtime manipulation and prompt injection attacks.

## System Components

### 1. Build-Time Compilation Pipeline

**Community Contribution Flow:**
```
Community YAML → Security Review → Static Analysis → Compilation → Testing → Deployment → Discovery Index
```

**Compilation Process:**
- **Parser**: Validates YAML syntax and schema compliance
- **Security Validator**: Performs static analysis and vulnerability scanning
- **Dependency Resolver**: Flattens nested workflows into linear execution plans
- **Bytecode Generator**: Creates immutable execution instructions
- **Embeddings Generator**: Builds searchable index for workflow discovery

### 2. Runtime Execution System

**Two-Tool Architecture:**
- `suggest_workflows`: Embeddings-based workflow discovery (non-deterministic)
- `execute_workflow`: Deterministic bytecode execution engine

**Execution Engine Features:**
- Operates on compiled bytecode, never interprets YAML at runtime
- Strong data typing prevents prompt injection through AWS API responses
- IAM-style permission validation with least-privilege enforcement
- Encrypted state management with automatic TTL cleanup
- Circuit breakers and timeout controls for resource protection

### 3. Security Model

**Prompt Injection Prevention:**
- All AWS API responses treated as opaque data, never as instructions
- Workflow execution flow determined entirely by compiled bytecode
- No dynamic interpretation of external content
- Structured output contracts with automatic sanitization

**Three-Tier Community Security:**

1. **Community Tier**
   - Basic validation and community peer review
   - Limited to read-only operations
   - Sandboxed execution environment
   - Maximum 5-minute execution time
   - Risk score ≤ 3.0

2. **Verified Tier**
   - AWS Labs security review and approval
   - Automated security scanning with static analysis
   - Write operations allowed with restrictions
   - Extended execution time (30 minutes)
   - Risk score ≤ 7.0

3. **Enterprise Tier**
   - Full security audit and penetration testing
   - Production deployment certification
   - Unrestricted permissions (within IAM bounds)
   - No execution time limits
   - SLA guarantees and support

### Compiled Bytecode Format

```json
{
  "workflow_id": "rds_backup_with_retention_v1_0",
  "checksum": "sha256:abc123def456...",
  "metadata": {
    "tier": "verified",
    "risk_score": 4.5,
    "max_duration": 1800,
    "required_permissions": ["rds:CreateDBSnapshot", "rds:DescribeDBSnapshots"]
  },

    }
  ]
}
```

## Nested Workflow Composition

### Progressive Complexity Model

**Primitives** (Atomic Operations):
```yaml
name: backup_rds_instance
description: "Create a single RDS snapshot"
type: primitive
steps:
  - create_snapshot: "create RDS snapshot for instance"
  - verify_completion: "wait for snapshot to complete"
```

**Patterns** (Composed Operations):
```yaml
name: setup_database_monitoring
description: "Complete database monitoring setup"
type: pattern
nested_workflows:
  - backup_rds_instance
  - create_cloudwatch_alarms
  - setup_sns_notifications
steps:
  - backup: 
      workflow: backup_rds_instance
      parameters: {instance_id: "${params.db_instance}"}
  - monitoring:
      workflow: create_cloudwatch_alarms
      parameters: {resource_id: "${params.db_instance}"}
  - alerts:
      workflow: setup_sns_notifications
      parameters: {topic_arn: "${params.alert_topic}"}
```

**Applications** (Complete Solutions):
```yaml
name: deploy_production_database
description: "Full production database deployment"
type: application
nested_workflows:
  - setup_database_monitoring
  - configure_backup_strategy
  - implement_security_controls
```

### Dependency Resolution

At build-time, nested workflows are flattened into a single execution graph:

```
deploy_production_database
├── setup_database_monitoring
│   ├── backup_rds_instance (primitive)
│   ├── create_cloudwatch_alarms (primitive)
│   └── setup_sns_notifications (primitive)
├── configure_backup_strategy
│   └── schedule_automated_backups (primitive)
└── implement_security_controls
    ├── configure_encryption (primitive)
    └── setup_access_controls (primitive)
```

**Compiled Result**: Single linear execution plan with 7 atomic operations.

## Discovery System

### Embeddings-Based Search

Workflows are indexed using the same embeddings infrastructure as `suggest_aws_commands`:

**Workflow Metadata for Embedding:**
```yaml
embedding_metadata:
  primary_text: "RDS backup database snapshot retention cleanup disaster recovery"
  use_cases:
    - "I need to backup my RDS database"
    - "How do I create automated database snapshots"
    - "Set up disaster recovery for RDS"
  services: ["rds", "backup", "sns", "cloudwatch"]
  complexity: "intermediate"
  risk_level: "low"
```

**Discovery Flow:**
```
User Query: "backup my database"
    ↓
Embeddings Search → Ranked Workflow Results
    ↓
Risk Filtering → Security-Appropriate Workflows
    ↓
Permission Check → User-Executable Workflows
    ↓
Present Options → User Selection
```

## Security Architecture

### Immutability Guarantees

1. **Checksum Validation**: Every compiled workflow has a cryptographic hash
2. **Bytecode Integrity**: Execution engine validates checksum before execution
3. **No Runtime Modification**: Workflow structure cannot be changed during execution
4. **Data Isolation**: AWS API responses cannot influence execution flow

### Permission Model

**Static Permission Calculation:**
```python
def calculate_workflow_permissions(workflow_definition):
    permissions = set()
    for step in workflow_definition.steps:
        if step.type == 'command':
            service_permissions = map_intent_to_permissions(step.intent, step.context)
            permissions.update(service_permissions)
    return list(permissions)
```

**Runtime Permission Validation:**
```python
async def validate_execution_permissions(user_context, workflow_permissions):
    for permission in workflow_permissions:
        if not user_context.has_permission(permission):
            raise PermissionDenied(f"Missing required permission: {permission}")
```

### Data Sanitization

**Structured Output Contracts:**
```python
class WorkflowStepResult:
    def __init__(self, raw_aws_response: dict):
        self.data = self._sanitize_response(raw_aws_response)
        self.metadata = {
            "step_id": "...",
            "execution_time": "...",
            "aws_request_id": "..."
        }
    
    def _sanitize_response(self, response: dict) -> dict:
        """Remove any content that could be interpreted as commands"""
        # Recursive sanitization removing CLI-like patterns
        # Convert all string values to safe data types
        # Strip any content matching command patterns
        pass
```

## Performance and Scalability

### Build-Time Optimization

**Compilation Benefits:**
- Dependency resolution: O(n) → O(1) at runtime
- Permission calculation: Complex analysis → Simple lookup
- Security validation: Comprehensive scan → Runtime skip
- Embeddings generation: Full analysis → Cached index

### Runtime Efficiency

**Stateless Execution Model:**
- Workers can be horizontally scaled
- No shared state between executions
- Load balancing across execution nodes
- Fault tolerance through redundancy

**Caching Strategy:**
```python
# Command suggestion caching
command_cache = LRUCache(
    max_size=1000,
    ttl=300,  # 5 minutes
    key_func=lambda intent, context: f"{intent}:{hash(context)}"
)

# Workflow result caching for idempotency
result_cache = TTLCache(
    max_size=10000,
    ttl=3600,  # 1 hour
    key_func=lambda workflow_id, params: f"{workflow_id}:{hash(params)}"
)
```

## Community Contribution Model

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### MCP Server Extension

The workflow system extends the existing aws-api-mcp-server with two new tools:

```python
@server.tool(name='suggest_workflows')
async def suggest_workflows(
    query: str,
    max_results: int = 5,
    risk_threshold: float = 5.0
) -> List[WorkflowSuggestion]:
    """Discover workflows using embeddings search"""
    
@server.tool(name='execute_workflow')
async def execute_workflow(
    workflow_name: str,
    parameters: dict,
    execution_mode: str = "step_by_step"
) -> WorkflowExecution:
    """Execute compiled workflow with security controls"""
```

### Backward Compatibility

- Existing `call_aws` and `suggest_aws_commands` tools remain unchanged
- No breaking changes to current MCP server functionality
- Workflows can use existing command suggestion infrastructure
- Gradual migration path for teams using specialized servers
